# SudokuProject
A Project where we had to implement backtracking for Sudoku and write a report about it.

Directory Structure:
- main.pdf -> Final report
- dataAnalysis -> Python code and stuff to generate the graphs and some latex
- text -> The latex folder containing the latex code (quite terrible)
- v1 -> Java code that contains the actual algorithm and experiment code.
